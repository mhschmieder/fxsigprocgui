# fxsigprocgui

JavaFX GUI controls and observable data models to go alongside jsigproc

This is a GUI library of controls and layouts that use JavaFX to model and represent core signal processing and DSP concepts, to the degree that they are generic enough to be considered public domain and not proprietary or subject to patents. This can serve as a jump-start for a company-specific implementation of custom filters, or can augment such work when designed to be accompanied by textbook implementations of parametric, all pass, high/low pass, etc.
